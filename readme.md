# Lifts

Demo [here](https://xdl-lifts.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/lifts.html)

This is a riff off a university coursework in which the mechanism of lifts had to be laid out in pseudocode, using the concept of message passing.

It was much more fun to hack out a graphical implementation of it in the event-driven world of JavaScript instead.

The graphics are powered by CreateJS, with Backbone Views pretending to be the processes. The graphics were exported using the CreateJS plugin for Flash CS6.
